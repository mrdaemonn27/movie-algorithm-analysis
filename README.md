# Movie Algorithm Analysis

This project is an interactive **movie management and algorithm analysis system**
built using **Python and Streamlit**.  
It implements **sorting, searching, and performance benchmarking algorithms**
on movie datasets.

---

## Features
- Movie data management from CSV files
- Sorting algorithms:
  - Quick Sort (Iterative & Recursive)
  - Insertion Sort (Iterative & Recursive)
- Searching algorithm:
  - Binary Search
- Algorithm performance benchmarking
- Interactive web-based interface using Streamlit

---

## Requirements
Make sure **Python 3.8 or newer** is installed.

Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib
```

## How to Run the Application
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

If the command above causes an error (recommended for Windows):
```bash
py -m streamlit run app.py
```
